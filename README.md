# clariTime


## a clarity-clarinet smart contract project based on the `stacks` (a bitcoin layer 2 economy) that focuses on the beginner's guide to learning blockchain with the clarity language using clarinet runtime built with cargo, the rust package manager.

## This project is about implementing a Time-locked Wallet smart contract. It basically allows users to deposit STX (the native token of Stacks) and withdraw them after a specified time period.

### Check out the README.md file of the project inside to get the full gist..

### Have fun with clariTime...
